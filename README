The "standard" 161 byte encoded copie_scr.sh script for launching SD card shell scripts on MMI 3G systems, while useful, doesn't take
full advantage of its native QNX environment, namely, in how it determines the path to the calling SD card root/base directory. I've
been using this frequently lately to look at various processes and file systems in our MMI 3G+ system, and found the "standard"
copie_scr.sh lacking, particularly with regard to its behavior when other removable media is connected to the system.

Inspection of "pidin" shows that the script launcher process (proc_scriptlauncher) identifies correctly the mount path to the SD card
in which the encoded copie_scr.sh script resides, for example:

  323657   24584 /bin/proc_scriptlauncher -i 30 -p /dev/shmem/copie_scr.sh
...
  966717  323657 ksh /dev/shmem/copie_scr.sh /mnt/sdcard10t12
  
and

  323657   24584 /bin/proc_scriptlauncher -i 30 -p /dev/shmem/copie_scr.sh
...
 1212477  323657 ksh /dev/shmem/copie_scr.sh /mnt/sdcard20t12

In the former case, the SD script is run from slot SD 1; in the latter, slot SD 2.

Thus, shell argument 1 to the encoded copie_scr.sh script contains the correct mount path to the SD card. Using this information about
the calling process, we can include it in a new (encoded) copie_scr.sh script:

#!/bin/ksh
# 20220102 drger; MMI3G SD shell script launcher
export SDPATH=$1
export PATH=$PATH:${SDPATH}/bin
export SDLIB=${SDPATH}/lib
export SDVAR=${SDPATH}/var
export SWTRAIN="$(cat /dev/shmem/sw_trainname.txt)"
mount -u $SDPATH
cd $SDPATH
exec ksh ./run.sh $SDPATH

Here, new exported environment variable SDPATH contains the value passed from the script launcher process as argument number 1 ($1).
And while we're at it, we can append our SD card bin directory to the PATH, and add a new SWTRAIN environment variable using the
contents of /dev/shmem/sw_trainname.txt (this is the MMI firmware version name) (along with a couple environment variables I use
routinely in my MMI SD scripts: SDLIB and SDVAR).

Finally, the new encoded copie_scr.sh script launches our plain-text "run.sh" shell script with argument $SDPATH for completeness.

The plain-text script is encoded with the tool available from GitHub project https://github.com/megusta1337/Copie_scr_Decoder.

The encrypted scripted is created with the compiled Copie_scr_Decoder tool:

./Copie_scr_Decoder < copie_scr.txt > copie_scr.sh

The tool can be used to read the encrypted script as plain-text:

./Copie_scr_Decoder < copie_scr.sh
